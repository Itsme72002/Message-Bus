This server patch contains modifications to HornetQ server including:
1. JMX to HTML porting.
2. Exposes consumer server list as JMX HTTP RPC.
3. Have the server periodically recycles unacknowledged messages instead of waiting for connection reset to free the resource. This is bound to the client's pull-like API.
4. Retrieve real message count from PageStore.
